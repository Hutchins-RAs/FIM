#' Data Cleaning Functions for FIM
#'
#' This module contains functions that combine data from various FIM sources to 
#' construct the input series that are used in the model itself. There are 33 (?)
#' functions, each producing a data series, which is a tibble containing a date
#' column and a data_series column.


# ---- Main-variables ----

#' Create Federal Purchases Data Series
#'

#' into a single data series, filling any gaps with placeholder zeroes extending to 2034 Q3.
