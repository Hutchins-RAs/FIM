# This is the point where we go from generating a data frame to actually calculating the FIM
######################################################################################

# This script defines the 33 input variables used in the FIM. It assumes that the 
# projections data frame is saved in memory from the section above having already
# been run.
source("src/define_inputs.R")

# Next, we source essential functions we need to calculate the FIM in this section.
# All of these modules contain nothing but functions. No actual code is executed
# when you source them. Instead, the code is executed in this script.
source("src/contributions.R")

# Another type of variable we need is MPC matrices. If you read the documentation
# in `src/mpc_lorae.R`, you'll develop a clearer understanding of how these 
# matrices produce an MPC operation. We cache these matrices so that they do not 
# need to be regenerated each time the code is run. Instead, in the future, we'll
# only rebuild these matrices when MPC inputs are changed using an "observer" 
# design pattern. This will save us a lot of computing time.

### CALCULATE THE FIM variable-by-variable ########################################

# The following section calculates FIM contributions for each of the 24 FIM
# output variables sequentially. 

# TOO: We should actually cache all of the FIM input variables - "accessory" and
# "main" - as well as all of the FIM outputs. Ideally, the FIM is triggered by
# an observer function, which sees a change in the state of an input variable or
# an MPC assumption, which then triggers a cascade of functions that re-calculate
# the FIM. The output is then shown on the Shiny app.

# Example FIM outputs, or "contributions", as we call them, since summing the
# 24 "contributions" leads to the top line FIM.
# For now, I copy the results to the clipboard so that I can view
# and compare the results to prior FIM results in Excel. These four examples
# use functions from the calculate_contributions.R script.
